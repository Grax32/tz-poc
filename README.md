# TzPoc

This is a proof of concept for 2 things.

* Using parent components in Angular to create a context object that can change the behavior of children objects
* A timezone picker and date formatter that accepts an ISO date string i.e. "2002-05-05T14:33Z" and outputs that into any supported timezone from Intl.supportedValuesOf("timezone")
